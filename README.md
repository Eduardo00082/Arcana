# Your Code Library!
</div>

**Arcana** is an immersive and private environment designed for developers and Prompt Engineers who want to organize their work (snippets, logic, and prompts) with absolute security. Unlike other tools, Arcana is **100% Offline-First**, ensuring your data never leaves your device.

## 🌌 The Aesthetic: Mystic-Tech
The design was built on the concepts of **Glassmorphism** and **Neon**, merging modern technology with the feel of an ancient spellbook.
* **Immersive Interface**: Mist effects, pulsing stars, and subtle transparencies.
* **Deck System**: Your notes are organized into modular cards with **flip** animations and fluid interaction.
* **Relaxing UI**: The app's design was crafted for those who work late into the night. The colors were carefully chosen to avoid eye strain!

## ✨ Key Features
- 🗂️ **Tag Organization**: Filter your cards instantly by language (TS, PY, SQL) or category.
- 🔄 **Flip Animation**: View the code on the front and technical details on the back of the card.
- 🛠️ **Snippet Editor**: Professional syntax highlighting and a character counter for productivity.
- 🔒 **Native Privacy**: Your data is saved locally on your device.
- 💾 **Arcane Backup**: A manual system for importing and exporting data for total security.

## 📖 About the Project
Arcana was born from the desire to create my own app—something that could actually be useful to people.

Developed entirely through a hybrid setup, using a **Chromebook** for coding via **GitHub Codespaces** and a **smartphone** for real-world testing, this project is the result of an intense collaboration between human and Artificial Intelligence.

I believe the role of a developer is evolving into something I never thought possible. I am just an ordinary person and a tech enthusiast who once didn't believe I could be even a fraction like the developers who dedicate themselves to creating apps. To me, this is art. And I value that. I’m not saying that using AI automatically makes me part of that community of artists. Maybe I’ll never be. But that doesn't mean I lack human creativity just because I use AI. I also want that feeling of creating something.

In this solo project, I treat AIs as more than just tools—we are collaborative partners. In Arcana, my job was to use different LLMs (Large Language Models) to build a tool that I personally needed, and that might be useful for you too. Even without knowing how to write a single line of code from scratch, I had to make small manual adjustments (often having to ask for very detailed comments. Please forgive the excessive comments cluttering the code, lol).

* **I do this as a hobby:** I am still in high school with no prior experience in programming. But I will dedicate myself to the fullest to this project (and perhaps future ones), doing everything within my current reach. All I want is to create something useful. :)

I believe everyone can do something. What matters is the result, regardless of the path you choose. I make projects as a hobby. I believe everyone has value. And your values are your desires and dreams. I believe in myself, and I believe in you :)
