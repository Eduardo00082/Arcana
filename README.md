# Your Code Library!
</div>

**Arcana** is an immersive and private environment designed for developers and Prompt Engineers looking to organize their work (snippets, logic, and prompts) with absolute security. Unlike other tools, Arcana is **100% Offline-First**, ensuring your data never leaves your device.

## 🌌 The Aesthetic: Mystic-Tech
The design was built on the concept of **Glassmorphism** and **Neon**, joining modern technology with the feel of an ancient spellbook.
* **Immersive Interface**: Mist effects, pulsing stars, and subtle transparencies.
* **Deck System**: Your notes are organized into modular cards with **flip** animations and fluid interaction.
* **Relaxing Interface**: The app's design was made to include people who work late into the night. The colors were chosen cautiously to not make you even more tired!

## ✨ Main Features
- 🗂️ **Tag Organization**: Filter your cards instantly by language (TS, PY, SQL) or category.
- 🔄 **Flip Animation**: View the code on the front and technical details on the back of the card.
- 🛠️ **Snippet Editor**: Professional syntax highlighting and character counter for productivity.
- 🔒 **Native Privacy**: Your data is saved locally on the device.
- 💾 **Arcane Backup**: Manual data import and export system for total security.

## 📖 About the Project
Arcana was born from the desire to create my own app, and that it could be useful for people.

Developed entirely through a hybrid setup, using a **Chromebook** for coding + **GitHub Codespaces** and a **cell phone** for real-world tests, this project is the result of an intense collaboration between human and artificial intelligence.

I believe that the role of the developer is evolving into something I never thought it could: Me, an ordinary person and technology enthusiast, who before didn't believe I could be, at least a fraction, equal to the developers who dedicate themselves to creating their apps. To me, this is art. And I value that. I'm not saying that using AI makes me part of this community of artists. Maybe I never will be. But that doesn't indicate that I also don't have human creativity just because I use AI. I also want the feeling of creating something.

In this solo project, I treat AIs as more than a tool, we are collaborative partners. In Arcana, my job was to use different LLMs (Large Language Models) to build a tool that I personally needed, and that maybe will be useful for you too. Even not knowing how to code a single line of code, I had to make small adjustments manually (even having to ask for more detailed comments. Please, forgive me for the amount of comments that just fatten the codes, lol).

* **I do it as a hobby:** I'm still in High School, without any experience in programming. But I will dedicate myself to the maximum in this project (and maybe in future projects), doing everything that is within my current reach. All I want is to create something useful. :)
